# simple_calc
This is a very simple calculator that can be cloned and extended in various ways. Emphasis here is on <b>simplicity</b> and code readability to the extent that anyone can easily understand what is going on very quickly and make changes. This effort is a fallout of my work at McGraw&amp;Hill.
